## Overview
BattleBanana is a wonderfully entertaining and fun addition to your discord server! BattleBanana is a RPG/quest based bot that allows you to create customizable quests, which members of your server can then come across and battle! You can also create weapons for your server members to use to kill the enemies or each other to gain EXP, stats and cash. It does not promise to provide you anything useful (unless you have a gambling addiction) but you may be able to have some fun with it.

### Features
Battlebanana is full of features like:
- Creating your own custom quests and weaponry
- Deciding rivalries through combat, or becoming top of the local or even global leaderboard!
- Creating your own team for you and your friends
- Customizable profiles to flex with
- Trying your luck by gambling (all) your cash

For more information on how to use the bot you can look at our ["how to"](https://battlebanana.xyz/howto/) guide!
